###Promises and other features in ES6 briefly..!
***

We implement a scenario in an imaginary business using 'Callbacks' in JavaScript ES5 and later we reimplement the scenario using 'Promises' and other language features in ES6. We will see how promises make the code so organized and elegant.

The imaginary business, we call it 'Cookie Business' is we buy the cookie dough from store, make cookies and then sell them to make  some money.

We consider the 3 stages of our 'Cookie Business' are asynchronous.

* getting cookie dough
* making cookies
* selling the cookies

We run our code in NodeJs. All the new ES6 languages features we see in this blog are available in the current version of NodeJs (v4.1.1 at the time of writing this blog). Therefore, we don't need to use any third party modules or libraries in our code. It is just 'JavaScript'.
